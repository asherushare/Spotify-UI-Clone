# Spotify-clone
<br>
<p>
  I successfully developed a Spotify website clone using HTML and CSS, demonstrating my expertise in front-end web development. The clone mirrors the user interface of the renowned music streaming platform, incorporating essential features like responsive design, intuitive navigation, and an aesthetically pleasing layout. This project showcases my proficiency in HTML for content structuring and CSS for styling, delivering an immersive and user-friendly experience akin to the original Spotify website.
